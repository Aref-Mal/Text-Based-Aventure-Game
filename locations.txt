You are in the Bahen Center. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying at the table near the doors. You better not disturb them. One student is rushing down
the corridor, wearing a heavy-looking backpack and carrying a textbook in their arms.
You remember studying for the CSC exam in one of the computer labs.
There is an exit from the building to St. George street to the East.

The sound of chatter and hurried footsteps reverbrate through the halls, as you navigate through the crowd.

You are now inside the Terrence Donnelly building. As soon as you enter, an impressive bamboo garden beckons,
offering a moment of escape from what has been a busy day. You remember taking a break there yesterday.
